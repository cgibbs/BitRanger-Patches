# BitRanger-Patches

I made this repo to store BitRanger patches that sound cool to me. Try them out, tweak them, and let me know if you come up with something cool, so that I can add it to this little library.

Sometimes I get excited about a track and forget to include the knob or switch settings. If you notice that they're missing on any patches, please let me know, and I'll fix and re-upload them.

You're free to use these patches and audio clips as you see fit. I'd be very happy if you credited me and linked to this repo wherever you use the stuff in it, but I'm not going to pursue any licensing bullshit.
