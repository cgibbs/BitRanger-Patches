# BitRanger-Patches

I made this repo to store BitRanger patches that sound cool to me. Try them out, tweak them, and let me know if you come up with something cool, so that I can add it to this little library.

Sometimes I get excited about a track and forget to include the knob or switch settings. If you notice that they're missing on any patches, please let me know, and I'll fix and re-upload them.

Audio tracks are recorded from my phone, so apologies for the quality.
